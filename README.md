# Eliminating Quantization Errors in Classification-Based Sound Source Localization

## Usage
The key contributions of this work lies in the '***encoding_decoding.py***' module, designed to be plug-and-play. Within this module, 'unbiased_encoding' and 'weighted_adjacent_decoding' functions are respectively employed to eliminate quantization errors during the training and decoding phases in deep learning-based sound source localization.
